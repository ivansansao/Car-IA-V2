# Cars-AI  

This project uses Google TensorFlow for the car's neural network.

The genetic algorithm selects the first one, clones it to generate the next generation in addition to keeping its superior and adding a new random one.

## üöÄ To run

Download the code and run the src/index.html on browser.

‚ö°Ô∏è Do you want to save learning?

It's not necessary to work but if you want to save automatically the weights then before to start file:///home/cars/src/index.html on browser you need to run "node main.js" on terminal, take a look above:

Run the server with:
~~~bash  
    cd src/server    
    node main.js
    Server is running on http://localhost:1905
~~~

‚ö°Ô∏è Do you want to receive messages on your telegram about the cars progress?

You need to create a bot on Telegram and get its token and user id first.

Rename file .env.example to .env and then configure these variables like examples below:

    TELEGRAM_TOKEN="5769999991:AalskdjfhaldskfjhasdfgddxW9xK-EJHJHI"
    TELEGRAM_USERID="8989898986"  
    SERVER_HOST=localhost  
    SERVER_PORT=1905

After remake your command: node main.js
